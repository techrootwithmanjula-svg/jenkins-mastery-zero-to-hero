# Jenkins Installation Guides

This repository contains step-by-step guides for installing Jenkins on different environments.  
Choose the one that fits your setup:

- [macOS](installation/macos.md)
- [Windows](installation/windows.md)
- [Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS)](installation/linux.md)
- [Docker](installation/docker.md)
- [Kubernetes](installation/kubernetes.md)

---

## Why multiple guides?
Jenkins installation steps are slightly different depending on your operating system or environment.  
Instead of making long videos for each, Iâ€™ve documented them here so you can follow along easily.
